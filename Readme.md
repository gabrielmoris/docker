# docker core Concepts

## Basics

**Containers**: Isolated "boxes" that contain our code and the environment needed to run it. 1 container must be focused in only 1 task.
**Images**: Created by docker files. They contain the code and the envidonment. They are the blueprint of the container and are readonly

## Basic commands

1. Build an Image
   `docker build -t <NAME:TAG> <path of dockerfile> `
2. Run a container based on a remote or local storage
   `docker run --name <name> --rm -d <IMAGE>` --rm => remove after stopping; -d detached mode
3. Push and pull to docker hub
   `docker push <REPOSITORY/NAME:TAG>` `docker pull <REPOSITORY/NAME:TAG>`

## Bind Mounts & Volumes

**Bind Mounts**: Used to connect to host machine folders
`-v /local/path:/container/path`

**Volume**: Used to persist the data
`-v NAME:/container/path`
