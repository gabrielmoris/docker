# Docker core Concepts

## Basics

**Containers**: Isolated "boxes" that contain our code and the environment needed to run it. 1 container must be focused in only 1 task.
**Images**: Created by docker files. They contain the code and the envidonment. They are the blueprint of the container and are readonly

## Basic commands

1. Build an Image
   `docker build -t <NAME:TAG> <path of dockerfile> `
2. Run a container based on a remote or local storage
   `docker run --name <name> --rm -d <IMAGE>` --rm => remove after stopping; -d detached mode
3. Push and pull to docker hub
   `docker push <REPOSITORY/NAME:TAG>` `docker pull <REPOSITORY/NAME:TAG>`

## Bind Mounts & Volumes

**Bind Mounts**: Used to connect to host machine folders
`-v /local/path:/container/path`

**Volume**: Used to persist the data
`-v NAME:/container/path`

## Networks and Container communication

**Create a docker network**: Using a network, containers can communicate with each other.

## Docker-compose

Allows to pre-define the build and run steps in a .yaml file. It is specially helpful in multiple containers project.

To call this file I use in the .yaml path the command `docker-compose up`. To stop the services I use `docker-compose down`

## Deploy considerations

- Replace **Bind Mounts** with Volumes or COPY
- Multiple containers might need multiple hosts
- Multi-stage Builds help with apps that need a build step

* **Control** : EC2 remote server, install Docker and run containers.
* **Ease-of-use**: ECS managed server, write the commands in AWS

# Kubernetes

Is a open-source system for orchestrating container deployments. It helps with **Automatic Deployment**, **Scaling & load balancing** and **Management**

<!-- ## In detail, this course includes the following topics:

    A thorough introduction to Docker, containers and why you might want to use Docker

    Detailed setup instructions for macOS and Windows

    A deep-dive into the core concepts you need to know: Containers & images

    Learn how to create custom images, use existing images and how to run containers based on such images

    Get a detailed overview of the core commands you need when working with Docker

    Learn how to work with data and how to persist data with volumes

    Explore container networking - with the outside world and between multiple containers

    Learn how to work with both single and multi-container projects

    In-depth deployment instructions: Manual deployment and deployment with managed services like AWS ECS

    Understand Kubernetes core concepts & architecture

    Learn how to create Kubernetes resources, deployments, services and how to run your containers with Kubernetes

    Dive deeply into working with data in Kubernetes projects - with different types of volumes
