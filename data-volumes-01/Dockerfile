# Here I am creating a detached app that has a Volume named feedback that will be bounded to the actual app and a anonnymouse volume 
# that is bounded to node_modules. Both volumes will coexist. The reason is that the volume shouldnÂ´t write in my local machine, that is why I need 2 different volumes.


# If I want too use a Bind Mounts (to check the image)

# for this I must add an anonymous volume with the node modules or make it in the command
